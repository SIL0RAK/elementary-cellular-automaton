implementation of elementary cellular automaton in rust web assembly.

[Wikipedia article about elementary cellular automaton ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)

implemented rules:

 - 30
 - 90
 - 110
 - 184
 - 250

 If you want to test different rule it is possible to do that by applying simple modification to the code.

## How to build

 0. install rust and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
 1. `wasm-pack build`
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm run build`

## Purpose

Purpose of this project is to test capabilities of rust web assembly and compare it to javascript implementation.
